# Repo:    matrix

The purpose of this code is to re-invent the wheel by writing methods to perform matrix operations intead of directly calling numpy methods. This is intended to improve understanding of code organization and object-oriented principles; it is recommended to use numpy (as opposed to this code) for any serious project requiring matrix operations.

## Description

This code is an incomplete work-in-progress. One can use this code to:

* calculate matrix determinants

* multiply two matrices

* solve a system of equations

Each of these methods contains sub-methods to verify that the calculated results agree with the results from numpy. I intend to add more methods at some point in the future.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.9.6
* numpy == 1.26.4

### Executing program

* Download this repository to your local computer

* Run `src/example_01-determinant.py`,  `src/example_02-matrix_multiplication.py`,  and `src/example_03-solved_system_of_equations.py`

## Version History
